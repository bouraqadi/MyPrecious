# MyPrecious: a Modular Middleware
I started this project after years of using or contributing to the development several middlewares including [rST](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/2288), [UbiquiTalk](https://www.slideshare.net/nourybouraqadi/ubiquitalk-an-infrastructure-for-ubiquitous-computing-esug-2006), [Seamless](https://github.com/pharo-ide/Seamless), [Simple Middleware](https://github.com/bouraqadi/PharoMisc/tree/master/SimpleMiddleware), or [PharoJS](https://github.com/bouraqadi/pharojs) Bridge. All these middleware difinitely share many concepts, and complement each other. 

Modularity is THE keyword behind *MyPrecious*. It should make it easy to implement most features and concepts from other middlewares listed above.
